# File Organizer

This project is made of three different parts.

The [first step](https://github.com/turriedoardo/file-organizer/blob/master/my_fileorganizer.ipynb) is a program which iterates over the files in the file system in alphabetical order, and move them to a specific folder, based on their format.

The second part is a [python script](https://github.com/turriedoardo/file-organizer/blob/master/addfile.py) which interacts with the user, taking as input the name of a file and moving it to a correct subfolder, based on the file extension.

Finally, in the [last step](https://github.com/turriedoardo/file-organizer/blob/master/my_fileorganizer.ipynb), I iterated over some images and printed out a table with many of their features (e.g. the color levels or the resolution), using the Image module of the PIL library to convert every image in a Numpy array.
